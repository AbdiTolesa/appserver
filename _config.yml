description: > # The objective of the project is to develop a multithreaded
  application server for PHP, written in PHP. Yes, pure PHP! You think we
  aren't serious? Maybe! But we think, in order to enable as many developers
  in our great community, this will be the one and only way. So with your
  help we hopefully establish a solution as the standard for enterprise
  applications in PHP environments.
